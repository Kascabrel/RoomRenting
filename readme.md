## Objective
- Create a simple web application for renting rooms with the clean architecture pattern.

## Usecase:
- create a room
- get a room
- get all rooms
- update a room
- delete a room
- rent a room/ this will be implemented in the future

## Technologies
- python clean architecture pattern for the backend
- Flask for the web framework
- SQLite for the database
- bootstrap and javascript  for the frontend

## How to run the application
- Clone the repository
- Install the requirements
- Run the application

## Requirements
- Python 3.12 and above
- Flask
- Flask-sqlalchemy

## How implement with the Clean Architecture pattern?
- The clean architecture pattern is a software design pattern that separates the code into
different layers. The main layers are the domain, usecase, and the interface. The domain 
layer contains the entities and the repository interfaces. The usecase layer contains the
usecases that are used to interact with the domain layer. The interface layer contains the
web framework and the database. The clean architecture pattern is a good pattern to use when
you want to separate the code into different layers and make it easier to test and maintain.
